# SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

As a recent employee with Pewlett Hackard, my first major task was a research project on employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The project included both Data Engineering and Data Analysis.

### I. Data Engineering
In order to perform this challenge, you first have to run the **schema.sql** code. This was created with PostgreSQL version 11. All the csv files are in the Resources directory.

### II. Data Analysis
The following questions were answered using the **analysis.sql** file with screenshots of the sample data ouput.
#### 1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
